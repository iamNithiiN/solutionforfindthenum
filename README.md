The provided code implements a number guessing game using a binary search algorithm.
It starts with a range of 1 to 1000 and makes guesses based on user feedback of 'h' (higher), 'l' (lower), or 'c' (correct).
The range is updated accordingly, and the program continues guessing until the correct number is found.
The code terminates by displaying the number of guesses made.
